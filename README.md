# Cataclysm Mods
A personal repository of mods for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead so I can hold onto them if they get deleted.

Mod list:

## Aftershock

Aftershock is my personal core content pack in the vein of Bright Nights. Right now, it does little, serving mainly to restore recipes that were realism'd out by Kevin.

## Despoiled

Makes a lot of food with spoilage timers that won't eveer matter to the average survivor (300 days? really?) "immortal" like before, such as dehydrated food and candy.

## Disciples of MacGyver

Adds a few new makeshift items and parts, such as mini-hacksaws and chain wrenches.

## Hi Sci-Fi

Includes items with largely science-fantasy elements that wouldn't fit in normal DDA, including a backpack with large volume with little encumberance, and an engine that runs forever.

Find the recipes in lab journal-Higgs, which spawns in labs.

## No Mole Rats

Blacklists the gigantic naked mole-rat, pure and simple.
