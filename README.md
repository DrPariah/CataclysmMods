# Cataclysm Mods
A personal repository of mods for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead so I can hold onto them if they get deleted.

Mod list:

## Hi Sci-Fi

Includes items with largely science-fantasy elements that wouldn't fit in normal DDA, including a backpack with large volume with little encumberance, and an engine that runs forever.

Find the recipes in lab journal-Higgs, which spawns in labs.

## Disciples of MacGyver

Adds a few new makeshift items and parts, such as mini-hacksaws and chain wrenches.
